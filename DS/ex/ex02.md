2. Indicate which of the following statements are true and
which are false. Justify your answers as best as you can.

a. Every integer is a real number.
--> True
b. O is a positive real number.
--> False
c. For all real numbers r, —r is a negative real number.
--> True
d. Every real number is an integer.
--> False

3. Let P(x) be the predicate “x > 1/x.”

a. Write P(2), P(1/2), P(—1), P(—1/2), and P(—8), and
indicate which of these statements are true and which
are false.

answers:
P(2) --> true
P(3) --> true
P(1/2) --> false
P(-1/2) --> true
P(1/2) --> false

b. Find the truth set of P(x) if the domain of x is R, the set
of all real numbers.

answers: {x ∈ R | x > 0, x ≠ 1}

c. If the domain is the set R+ of all positive real numbers,
what is the truth set of P(x)?

answers:

If the domain is the set of all positive real numbers (R+), then the condition "x > 0" is automatically satisfied. However, the condition "x ≠ 1" remains crucial.

Therefore, the truth set of P(x) when the domain is R+ becomes:

{x ∈ R+ | x ≠ 1}
