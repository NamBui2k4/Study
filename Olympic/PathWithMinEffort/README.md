# Path With Minimum Effort

You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where __heights[row][col]__ represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, __(0, 0)__, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, __(rows-1, columns-1)__ (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return __the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell__.
