1. A network 180.80.0.0. /16 is sub-netted using VLSM, and the requirements are to create the following three subnets: Subnet-1 has 500 hosts; Subnet-2 is with 107 hosts; Subnet-3 has 30 hosts. Subnet-1 subnet mask will be:
255.255.255.224
255.255.254.0
255.255.224.254
__255.255.255.254__

explain:

VLSM subnetting allows us to create subnets with different subnet masks based on our requirements and network size1. To find the subnet mask for Subnet-1, we need to follow these steps:

Add two to the host requirement of Subnet-1 to account for the network address and the broadcast address. Subnet-1 needs 500 + 2 = 502 IP addresses.
Find the block size that can accommodate 502 IP addresses. The block size is the number of IP addresses we get when we convert a host bit into a network bit. The following table shows the block sizes for different host bits2:
Table

| Host bit (s) |Block size|
|--------------|----------|
| 1	           |2         |
| 2	           |4         |
| 3	           |8
| 4	           |16
| 5	           |32
| 6	           |64
| 7	           |128
| 8	           |256
| 9	           |512

The smallest block size that can fit 502 IP addresses is 512. This means we need to convert 9 host bits into network bits.

Subtract 9 from 32 to get the number of network bits. The number of network bits is 32 - 9 = 23.

Write the subnet mask in binary notation by placing 23 ones followed by 9 zeros. The subnet mask in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000

=> 255.255.254.0

2. What is the broadcast address for the subnet 192.168.1.32/27?

192.168.1.31
192.168.1.255
192.168.1.224
__192.168.1.63__

3. When a computer wants to broadcast a message to all other computers on the network, what is the destination MAC address?

__FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF__
00-00-00-00-00-00
None of the above
11-11-11-11-11-11

4. Which of the following is a routing protocol that uses a link-state database to calculate the best path to a destination network?

RIP
EIGRP
__OSPF__
BGP

explain:

A routing protocol that uses a link-state database to calculate the best path to a destination network is OSPF. This is the correct answer among the given options.

OSPF is a link-state protocol that exchanges information about the network topology between routers. Each router generates and floods link-state advertisements (LSAs) to its neighbors, which describe the state of the router links to the area. The routers store the received LSAs in the link-state database (LSDB), which gives them a picture of the network. OSPF then uses the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm to compute the best routes based on the LSDB12.

RIP and EIGRP are distance vector protocols, which exchange information about the distance and direction to destination networks. They do not maintain a link-state database, but rather a routing table that contains only the best routes to each destination. BGP is a path vector protocol, which exchanges information about the path attributes of destination networks. It also does not use a link-state database, but rather a BGP table that contains all the available paths to each destination1

5. Which of the following is a characteristic of a half-duplex transmission mode?

It is more secure than full-duplex transmission.
It allows data to be transmitted in both directions simultaneously.
__It allows data to be transmitted in only one direction at a time.__
It is faster than full-duplex transmission.

explain:

The correct answer is It allows data to be transmitted in only one direction at a time. This is a characteristic of a half-duplex transmission mode.

A half-duplex transmission mode is a type of communication mode that allows data to flow in both directions, but not at the same time12. When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa. The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time. The entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for each direction

What is the network address of IP address 10.1.43.61/29?
10.1.43.53/29
10.1.43.54/29
__10.1.43.56/29__
10.1.43.55/29

explain:

The network address of IP address 10.1.43.61/29 is 10.1.43.56/29. This is the correct answer among the given options. I can explain how to find the network address using the subnet mask and CIDR notation.

A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that defines how many bits of the IP address are used for the network prefix and how many for the host part1. CIDR notation is a way of writing the subnet mask as a slash followed by the number of network bits2. For example, 10.1.43.61/29 means that the subnet mask has 29 ones and 3 zeros, or 255.255.255.248 in decimal notation.

To find the network address, we need to perform a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask. This means that we compare each bit of the IP address with the corresponding bit of the subnet mask, and if both are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, the result is 02. The following table shows the calculation in binary form:

| IP address | 00001010.00000001.00101011.00111101    |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Subnet mask | __11111111.11111111.11111111. 11111000__  |
| Network prefix| __00001010.00000001.00101011.00111000__ |

The network prefix in decimal form is 10.1.43.56, which is the network address. The host part is the remaining 3 bits, which can have 8 possible values, from 0 to 7. Therefore, the IP range of this subnet is from 10.1.43.56 to 10.1.43.63, with 10.1.43.56 being the network address and 10.1.43.63 being the broadcast address2

7. Which flag in the TCP header is used to indicate that the sender is resetting a connection?
ACK
FIN
SYN
__RST__

The correct answer is RST. This is the flag in the TCP header that is used to indicate that the sender is resetting a connection.

The RST flag (reset) is set whenever a TCP packet doesn’t comply with the protocol’s criteria for a connection, or when the sender wants to abort the connection for some reason12. For example, the RST flag can be sent in response to receiving a packet for a closed socket, or when the receiver detects an invalid sequence number or a checksum error3.

The other options are incorrect because:

ACK: This is the flag that is used to acknowledge the receipt of data packets or connection requests. It is not used to reset a connection.
FIN: This is the flag that is used to indicate that the sender has no more data to send and wants to close the connection gracefully. It is not used to reset a connection.
SYN: This is the flag that is used to initiate a connection by synchronizing the sequence numbers of the sender and the receiver. It is not used to reset a connection.

8. Which one is NOT a characteristic of the network layer?

Connectionless
Media independent
Best effort
__Error checking__

The correct answer is Error checking. This is NOT a characteristic of the network layer.

The network layer is the third layer of the OSI model, which is responsible for establishing paths and transferring data packets between different networks1. The network layer has the following characteristics:

Connectionless: The network layer does not establish or maintain a connection between the sender and the receiver. It treats each packet independently and does not guarantee the order or delivery of the packets2.

Media independent: The network layer does not depend on the physical layer or the data link layer to transmit the packets. It can use any type of network media, such as copper, fiber, or wireless, as long as it supports the network layer protocols2.

Best effort: The network layer does not provide any reliability or quality of service for the packets. It tries its best to deliver the packets, but it does not guarantee that they will reach their destination or that they will be error-free2.

Error checking is a characteristic of the data link layer, which is the second layer of the OSI model. The data link layer is responsible for ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the data frames that are transmitted over the physical layer3. The data link layer uses techniques such as checksums, cyclic redundancy checks (CRC), and acknowledgments to detect and correct errors in the data frames

9. If a host has the address 172.16.45.14/30, what is the subnet that this host belongs to?
__172.16.45.12/30__
172.16.45.16/30
172.16.45.8/30
172.16.45.20/30

The subnet that the host 172.16.45.14/30 belongs to is 172.16.45.12/30. This is the correct answer among the given options. I can explain how to find the subnet address using the IP address and the subnet mask.

The subnet mask is a 32-bit number that defines how many bits of the IP address are used for the network prefix and how many for the host part1. The subnet mask can be written in CIDR notation as a slash followed by the number of network bits, such as /302. For example, 172.16.45.14/30 means that the subnet mask has 30 ones and 2 zeros, or 255.255.255.252 in decimal notation.

To find the subnet address, we need to perform a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask. This means that we compare each bit of the IP address with the corresponding bit of the subnet mask, and if both are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, the result is 02. The following table shows the calculation in binary form:

| IP address | 10101100.00010000.00101101.00001110 | | Subnet mask | 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100 | | Subnet address| 10101100.00010000.00101101.00001100 |

The subnet address in decimal form is 172.16.45.12, which is the network address

9. Which of the following is an advantage of using a private IP address?
__It increases network security by preventing outside access to the network.__
It allows direct access to the internet.
It provides a unique address for each device on the network.
It simplifies network configuration by eliminating the need for subnetting

The correct answer is It increases network security by preventing outside access to the network. This is an advantage of using a private IP address

The other options are incorrect because:

It allows direct access to the internet: This is not true. Private IP addresses cannot be used to access the internet directly, as they are not recognized or routed by the public internet. They need to be translated into public IP addresses using a router or a NAT device1.

It provides a unique address for each device on the network: This is not necessarily true. Private IP addresses are not allocated to any specific organization or device, and anyone may use them without approval from regional or local internet registries. Therefore, private IP addresses can be reused or duplicated across different networks, as long as they are not connected or overlapping. For example, many routers use the default private IP address of 192.168.1.1, which means that many devices in different networks can have the same private IP address1.

It simplifies network configuration by eliminating the need for subnetting: This is not true. Subnetting is a technique of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks, or subnets, to improve network performance, security, and management. Subnetting can be applied to both private and public IP addresses, and is not affected by the type of IP address. In fact, subnetting is often used to create multiple subnets within a private network, using different subnet masks and CIDR notation2.

10. What is the purpose of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)?

To resolve domain names to IP addresses.
__To resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses__.
To resolve MAC addresses to IP addresses.
To resolve IP addresses to domain names.

ARP is a network protocol that is used to find out the hardware (MAC) address of a device from an IP address. It is used when a device wants to communicate with some other device on a local network, such as an Ethernet network, that requires physical addresses to be known before sending packets1.

The other options are incorrect because:

To resolve domain names to IP addresses: This is not the purpose of ARP, but of the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a protocol that maps human-readable domain names, such as www.bing.com, to numerical IP addresses, such as 204.79.197.2002.
To resolve MAC addresses to IP addresses: This is not the purpose of ARP, but of the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP), which is a protocol that is used to find out the IP address of a device from its MAC address. RARP is rarely used today, as most devices can obtain IP addresses dynamically using protocols such as DHCP or BOOTP3.
To resolve IP addresses to domain names: This is not the purpose of ARP, but of the Reverse DNS (rDNS), which is a process that maps IP addresses to domain names. rDNS is mainly used for security and diagnostic purposes, such as verifying the identity of an email sender or a website visitor4.

11. What is the MAXIMUM number of usable IP addresses of Network address 130.20.0.0/25?
126
64
254
128

12. If the MAC address is FC:99:47:75:CE:E0, What would the EUI-64 Interface ID be?
fc:99:47:ff:fe:75:ce:e0
20:99:47:ff:fe:75:ce:e0
fe:99:47:fe:ff:75:ce:e0
__fe:99:47:ff:fe:75:ce:e0__

The correct answer is fe:99:47:ff:fe:75:ce:e0. This is the EUI-64 Interface ID that is derived from the MAC address FC:99:47:75:CE:E0. I can explain how to find the EUI-64 Interface ID using the MAC address and the EUI-64 format.

The EUI-64 format is a method of generating a unique 64-bit interface identifier for IPv6 addresses using the 48-bit MAC address of the interface1. The EUI-64 format consists of the following steps:

Split the MAC address into two 24-bit parts. The first part is the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), and the second part is the device identifier. For example, FC:99:47 is the OUI, and 75:CE:E0 is the device identifier.
Insert the hexadecimal value FFFE in between the two 24-bit parts. This creates a 64-bit value. For example, FC:99:47:FF:FE:75:CE:E0.
Invert the seventh bit of the first octet. This is the universal/local (U/L) bit, which indicates whether the address is globally unique or locally administered. If the bit is 0, it is inverted to 1, and vice versa. For example, since the first octet is FC, which is 11111100 in binary, the seventh bit is 1, and it is inverted to 0. The first octet becomes FE, which is 11111110 in binary.

13. What is the primary function of the control plane in the network layer?
Forwarding data packets
Establishing connections
Maintaining network security
Determine route taken by packets from source to destination

14. Formatting and compressing are used in the following layer:
Transport layer
Presentation layer
Network layer
Session layer

15. Which of the following is NOT a function of the transport layer?
Flow control
__Encryption__
Congestion control
Error detection

The correct answer is Encryption. This is NOT a function of the transport layer.

The transport layer is the fourth layer of the OSI model, which is responsible for reliable and efficient data transmission between devices. It performs functions such as flow control, congestion control, error detection, and correction1.

Encryption is a function of the presentation layer, which is the sixth layer of the OSI model. The presentation layer is responsible for transforming the data into a format that can be understood by the application layer. It performs functions such as data compression, data encryption, and character encoding2.
