# An Introduction to Problem-Solving using Search Algorithms for Beginners

## Overview

In computer science, problem-solving refers to artificial intelligence techniques, including various techniques such as forming efficient algorithms, heuristics, and performing root cause analysis to find desirable solutions.

The basic crux of artificial intelligence is to solve problems just like humans.

## Examples of Problems in Artificial Intelligence

In today’s fast-paced digitized world, artificial intelligence techniques are used widely to automate systems that can use the resource and time efficiently. 

Some of the well-known problems experienced in everyday life are games and puzzles. Using AI techniques, we can solve these problems efficiently. In this sense, some of the most common problems resolved by AI are:

- Travelling Salesman Problem
- Tower of Hanoi Problem
- Water-Jug Problem
- N-Queen Problem
- Chess
- Sudoku
- Crypt-arithmetic Problems
- Magic Squares
- Logical Puzzles and so on.

## Problem Solving Techniques

In artificial intelligence, problems can be solved by using searching algorithms, evolutionary computations, knowledge representations, etc.

In this article, I am going to discuss the various searching techniques that are used to solve a problem.

In general, searching is referred to as finding information one needs.

The process of problem-solving using searching consists of the following steps.

- Define the problem
- Analyze the problem
- Identification of possible solutions
- Choosing the optimal solution
- Implementation

Let’s discuss some of the essential properties of search algorithms.

## Properties of search algorithms

1. Completeness

A search algorithm is said to be complete when it gives a solution or returns any solution for a given random input.

2. Optimality

If a solution found is best (lowest path cost) among all the solutions identified, then that solution is said to be an optimal one.

3. Time complexity

The time taken by an algorithm to complete its task is called time complexity. If the algorithm completes a task in a lesser amount of time, then it is an efficient one.

4. Space complexity

It is the maximum storage or memory taken by the algorithm at any time while searching.

These properties are also used to compare the efficiency of the different types of searching algorithms.

## Types of search algorithms
Now let’s see the types of the search algorithm.

Based on the search problems, we can classify the search algorithm as

- Uninformed search (US)
- Informed search (IS)
