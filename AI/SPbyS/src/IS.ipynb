For example – Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, etc. (Lesser the distance, closer the goal.) Different heuristics are used in different informed algorithms discussed below. "

    "A heuristic is a function that determines how near a state is to the desired state. We can see this as the cost path from the current node to next one. However, this cost path is estimated, which means it is not accuracy in reality. The aim is to find a approximate answer, even if it is not ideal. \n",
