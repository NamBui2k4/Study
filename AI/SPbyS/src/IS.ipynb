    "\n",
    "A* Algorithm is basically an artificial intelligence problem used for the pathfinding (from point A to point B) and the Graph traversals. This algorithm is flexible and can be used in a wide range of contexts\n",

    "This algorithm was first published by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael in 1968.\n",
    "\n",
    "### heuristic function\n",
    "\n",
    "In A*, if there are no answers to a problem, or the time required to find one is too great, a heuristic function is used to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A heuristic is a function that determines how near a state is to the desired state. We can see this as the cost path from the current node to next one. However, this cost path is estimated, which means it is not accuracy in reality. The aim is to find a approximate answer, even if it is not ideal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider n as the current state (not initial state). The desired path with be decided by evaluation function $f(n)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  f(n) = h(n) + g(n)$$\n",

    "where:\n",
    "- $g(n)$: cost from initial state to n\n",

    "- $f(n)$: evaluation function - estimated cost of the cheapest solution through 𝑛\n",
    "\n",
    "***p/s: Sometime, h(n) and g(n) have no mesurement unit in common. For ex, h(n) could be mesured as km, and the g(n) hours either. However, f(n) must unify them such as km/h***\n",

    "\n",
    "In every visiting, one state will be chosen and the cost will be update. This cost will be added to heuristic function to get evaluation value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses this value to decide which state will be chosen in next visiting.  Heuristics functions vary depending on the problem and must be tailored to match that particular challenge. A* always find that path if it exist.\n",
