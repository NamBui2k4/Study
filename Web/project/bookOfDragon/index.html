        <div class="quote_img border_left">
          <blockquote>"The Terrible Terror. Smallest of the dragons, but no less ferocious. 
            You know it's about to breathe fire when you hear a small hissing sound.
            By taming it start with a shiny object."
            <cite> - Gobber </cite><br>
            <p>The Terrible Terror is a small Stoker Class dragon 
            that first appeared in How to Train Your Dragon.</p>

            Speed: Unknown. <br>
            Size: Unknown. <br>
            The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself. 
            Never engage this dragon. Your only chance: Hide and pray it does not find you."
            <cite> -  Hiccup as he reads through the Dragon Manual	 </cite><br>
            <p>The Night Fury was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and 
              fearsome species of dragons. They preferred to attack at night, when their 
              black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.
              <br><br>
              Night Furies have the ability to "dive bomb," meaning 
              that they can plummet from great heights, gaining speed as they continue 
              downwards, then shoot a "plasma blast" at their target
              .</p>

            <cite> -   Heather and Astrid about the Deadly Nadder	 </cite><br>
            <p> Deadly Nadders are long and serpentine, and at least come in the colors 
            of green or purple. Their bodies are so long and rope like, that they can get 
            tangled when sleeping together for winter hibernation.</p><br>
            <p>	Deadly Nadders can suddenly raise the hundreds of sharp spines that 
            stud their hides and tails and fling them with incredible accuracy. 
            But when the shooting starts, there is no safer place to be than face-to-face with a Nadder</p>

            <cite> — Hiccup introducing the Gronckle. </cite><br>
            <p>The Gronckle is described as the "plug ugly" of the dragon world. 
              They are rather rotund, and can easily get too overweight to fly. <br><br>
              They are also prone to dragon acne, perhaps accounting for their pimply hides. 
              Gronckles also have huge sharp teeth..</p><br>
              <p>Gronckles can also grow rather large for a Hunting dragon. 
                The Thin Prefect's Gronckle is stated to be two meters high (roughly 6.5 feet) 
                and is able to pick up two boys in its mouth simultaneously. 
                He also sports a horned ruff around his neck, something not seen in images of Gronckles.</p>

            nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.”
            
            <cite>— Hiccup introducing the Monstrous Nightmare	 </cite><br>
            <p> Monstrous Nightmares are styled rather devilishly, 
              with two curved horns on their heads, and physically resemble a western-style dragon.
              <br><br>

              Nightmares vary in size, but can be the largest of the hunting dragons. 
              They are rated as Size 3 in The Incomplete Book of Dragons, placing them 
              in the same size category as small Riding Dragons such as the Chickenpoxer or Zebramount.</p>

            <p>Hideous Zipplebacks are rather colorful and have many different

              <br><br>
              The head on the right side breathes a green,
              flammable gas, while the left head produces an electrical spark from

              <p> Native to dense, wooded area, Timberjacks are acutely sensitive 
                creatures that prefer the peace and solace found in their beloved forests.
                But don't let their introspective demeanor fool you. When attacked, 
                betrayed or offended, Timberjacks will start flailing their expansive wings, 
                whose edges are razor-sharp — sharp enough to shear through the thickest 
                tree trunk and still not slow down a Timberjack's flight.
                <br><br>
  
                Those huge wings do more than just chop trees. On the ground, 
                Timberjacks also have the ability to fold their wings around 
                weary riders like a makeshift tent, offering warmth and protection
