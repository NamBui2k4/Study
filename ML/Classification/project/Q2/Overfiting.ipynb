    "# 1. Overfitting problem in machine learning\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overfitting - what is overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometime when training a model, the accuracy of the training set gradually increases (loss gradually decreases), but the accuracy of the test set does not increase with the training set. However, at a certain stage, the accuracy of the test set will gradually decrease (loss gradually increases). \n",
    "\n",
    "That is Overfitting - an unwanted machine learning behavior that occurs when a machine learning model makes accurate predictions for training data but not for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When scientists use machine learning models to make predictions, they first train the model on a known data set. Then, based on this information, the model tries to predict outcomes for new data sets. An overfit model can make inaccurate predictions and may not perform well for all types of new data.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why does overfitting occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "• The training data size is too small and does not contain enough data samples to accurately represent all possible input data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Training data contains a large amount of irrelevant information, called noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The model trains too long on a single sample dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Due to high complexity, the model also learns the noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Signs of overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High accuracy on the training data set, but low on the test data set\n",
    "- The model learns the noise and individual characteristics of the training data set, instead of learning the main relationships\n",
    "- Complex model with many parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "## For example\n",
    "1. Classify cat and dog photos:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have 100 cat photos and 100 dog photos. You want to build a model to classify cat and dog photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "If trained on a dataset containing mostly pictures of dogs and cats in parks, an ML model might learn to use grass for classification but not recognize a dog in the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to detect overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to detect model overfitting is to test machine learning models with lots of data representing all possible input values ​​and types. Usually, a portion of the training data is used as testing data to check for overfitting. A high error rate in test data is an indication of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Solution to avoid overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "## General solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase dataset size: Give the model more data to learn general relationships.\n",
    "- Use data collection techniques: Remove noise and extraneous data from the data set.\n",
    "- Simplify the model: Reduce the number of model parameters or use a model with a simpler structure.\n",
    "- Use regularization techniques: Add constraints to the cost function to prevent the learning model from being too complex.\n",
    "- Use early stopping technique: Stop the training process when the model begins to learn individual characteristics of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solutions for each specific machine learning method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear regression:\n",
    "    + Use L1 or L2 regularization.\n",
    "    + Use feature selection.\n",
    "- Decision tree:\n",
    "    + Limit tree depth.\n",
    "    + Use pruning.\n",
    "- Neural network:\n",
    "    + Use dropout.\n",
    "    + Use early stopping.\n",
    "    + Use regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning. To avoid overfitting, you should use techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase the amount of training data\n",
    "- Reduce model complexity\n",
    "- Use regularization techniques\n",
    "- Use cross-validation to evaluate model effectiveness"
