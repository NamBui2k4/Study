    "Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that in everyday life, you are still using the Decision Tree method? For example, you go to the supermarket to buy milk for the whole family. The first question in your mind will be: How much milk do you need to buy?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will determine: If it is a weekday, your family will use 1 liter of milk, and on the weekend it will be 1.5 liters. Thus, based on the day, you will decide the amount of food to buy for your family.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a form of binary decision tree.\n",
